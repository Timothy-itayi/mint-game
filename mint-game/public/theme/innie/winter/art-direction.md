# INNIE Winter - Art Direction

> Month 12. The end of the year. Peak intimacy. A world fully lived-in.

---

## Season Overview

**Timeline Position:** Month 12 (Player's entry point)
**Mood:** Intimate, settled, melancholic warmth against cold
**Feeling:** Home. Comfort. The weight of a year together.

This is where players begin. Everything must feel **established**—relationships, routines, the wear of time. The visual language should communicate "you've been here a while" without saying it.

## Colour Palette

Based on: `innie-winter-colour-pallet.png`

### Primary Colours

| Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| White Baltic | #FFFFFF | 255, 255, 255 | Highlights, breath, frost on windows |
| Ice Blue | #E0FFFF | 224, 255, 255 | Light surfaces, reflections |
| Pale Cyan | #B0E0E6 | 176, 224, 230 | Background elements, sky through windows |
| Winter Teal | #6BBFC7 | 107, 191, 199 | Mid-tones, UI elements, accents |
| Deep Teal | #3A9CA8 | 58, 156, 168 | Shadows, depth, text backgrounds |
| Baltic Dark | #2A7A88 | 42, 122, 136 | Deep shadows, contrast elements |

### Colour Application

**Kitchen Interior:**
- Warm artificial lighting contrasts with cool window light
- Stainless steel reflects the cool tones
- Wood surfaces provide warmth against the cold palette
- Steam and condensation pick up the icy highlights

**Emotional Coding:**
- Cool exterior (the world outside) vs. warm interior (the relationship)
- The cold palette makes warmth feel earned
- Elizabeth brings subtle warmth into Howard's cool world

### Accent Colours (Warmth)

To balance the cool palette, introduce warmth through:

| Element | Colour | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Kitchen lighting | Warm amber #FFB347 | Overhead fixtures, warmth |
| Food colours | Natural produce tones | Life, humanity |
| Elizabeth's presence | Subtle warm accent | She's the warmth |
| Notes/paper | Cream #FFF8DC | Personal, intimate |

## Kitchen Layout

### Overview

The kitchen is the **primary play space** for all innie segments. It should feel:
- Functional and real (based on actual commercial kitchen layout)
- Contained but not claustrophobic
- Worn from a year of use (Month 12)
- Personalized—Howard has made this space his own

### Key Areas

- View toward pass window (can see front of house activity)

**The Pass Window**
- Connection point to front of house
- Where Howard glimpses Elizabeth
- Food goes out, dishes come back
- The threshold between worlds

**Cold Storage**
- Liminal space for mystery moments
- Where Jacob shares conspiracy theories

- Can see him but rarely interacts

**Packing Area**

- Lighter energy than kitchen proper

### Winter-Specific Details

**Environmental Storytelling:**

- The world Howard reaches toward
- A warmer, customer-facing contrast to the kitchen

### Key Elements

**Elizabeth's Till**
- Positioned with view toward pass window
- She can see kitchen activity
- Howard can see her when he approaches the pass
- The sight line is their connection

**Refrigerated Display**
- Where packed kitchen meals go
- Howard's excuse to come to front ("restocking")
- The bridge between their worlds

**Shop Atmosphere (Winter)**
- Boutique grocer aesthetic—quality over quantity
- Warm lighting (contrast to cold outside)
- Holiday touches—tasteful, not overdone
- Customers bundled in winter clothing

### The Pass Window (The Threshold)

This is the most important visual element connecting kitchen and front:
- Where food goes out
- Where Howard and Elizabeth's worlds touch
- Warm kitchen light spilling into cooler shop
- The frame through which they see each other

---

## Visual Storytelling - Winter

### What the Art Should Communicate

**Without words, the player should feel:**
1. This is late in the timeline (worn, settled, personalized)
2. Howard belongs here (his station is HIS)
3. There's warmth in this cold season (the relationship)
4. Something melancholic (year ending, something about to change)

### Key Visual Moments

**Howard at his station:**
- Comfortable, automatic movements
- Eyes occasionally flicking toward pass window
- A note tucked where only he'd see it

**Glimpse of Elizabeth:**
- Through pass window, soft focus
- Warm against cool
- The pull between them visible in framing

**The kitchen at rest:**
- End of day, lights dimming
- The space holds the memory of the day
- Quiet, intimate, a breath before change

*Winter is the end that feels like a beginning. The player enters here thinking this is the start—but everything they see was built over a year they haven't witnessed yet.*
