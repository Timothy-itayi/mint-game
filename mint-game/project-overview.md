# Project Mint

> A psychological mystery card game about fractured time, split identity, and the lies we tell ourselves to keep going.

---

## What Is This?

**Project Mint** is a web-based narrative card game that combines **Memento's reverse chronology** with **Severance's personality severance** in an industrial kitchen setting. Players experience a story told backwards, uncovering not just what happened—but why they chose to forget.

---

## The Protagonist

**Howard, 25**

An artist who never makes art. Pencil and charcoal drawings were his thing as a kid, but he "never had time" as an adult. His apartment is decrepit—filled with art books, half-started sketches, empty canvases. Nothing finished. Nothing real.

He chose severance to "finally dedicate time to his creative work." That was the lie.

The truth? Howard is drowning in self-loathing. He doesn't believe he's worthy of anything—success, love, happiness. The severance wasn't about reclaiming time. It was about escaping himself. Deleting 8 hours of consciousness per day so he didn't have to be Howard for that long.

But his innie doesn't know any of this. His innie just washes dishes, preps food, and slowly falls in love with a girl at the till.

---

## The Self-Betrayal

Like Leonard in Memento, who lied to himself forever to avoid the truth about his wife. Like Mark in Severance, whose innie saved his wife only for him to stay with someone else.

**Howard chose fragmentation over wholeness because wholeness was too painful.**

The horror isn't the severance. The horror is realizing why you needed it.

## Elizabeth

**Elizabeth, 23** - Retail worker at the till

She lives across the hall from Howard. Same apartment building, adjacent units. They've met before—brief hallway encounters, polite nods, small talk by the mailboxes.

She liked what she saw. Howard was standoffish, self-conscious, never returning her advances beyond friendly neighbor vibes. But she saw something in him. Potential. Something worth pursuing.

When she noticed Howard started working at the grocer—when she figured out he'd severed—she made a decision. She applied for the till position. She severed too.

Not to save him. Not because she had to. Just because she wanted to be where he was.

**Elizabeth isn't a manic pixie dream girl.** She's just a normal person who found a guy handsome enough to pursue. Love of the game.

## The Structure

### Part 1: INNIE (Backwards Through Time)

```
WINTER (Month 12) → AUTUMN (Month 9) → SUMMER (Month 6) → SPRING (Month 1)
```

The player experiences the work timeline in reverse. We start at Month 12, where Howard and Elizabeth's relationship is established, intimate, real. Then we watch it fade backwards—from comfort to crush to strangers.

**The challenge:** The world must feel lived-in from the jump. Relationships are established. The kitchen has rhythms. Then it all unwinds to the beginning.

**What the player learns:**
- Innie-Howard is present, open, capable of love
- He built something real with Elizabeth
- By Spring (the beginning), they're strangers—and the player feels the loss

### Part 2: OUTIE (Forward Through Time)

```
SPRING (Month 1) → SUMMER (Month 6) → AUTUMN (Month 9) → WINTER (Month 12)
```

Now the player sees Howard's outside life. The hollow apartment. The art that never happens. The self-loathing that keeps him paralyzed.

Elizabeth appears in the margins—hallway run-ins, elevator encounters, moments where Howard is caught off guard. We see he's interested. But he can't make himself act.

**What the player learns:**
- While the innie was falling in love, the outie was rotting
- Howard missed everything because he couldn't look up from his self-hatred
- Elizabeth was there the whole time, waiting

### Part 3: CONVERGENCE (Winter Meets Winter)

Both timelines collapse into one moment.

**The Temporal Bleed:**
- Memories don't transfer. But feelings do.
- A sense of déjà vu. A pull toward Elizabeth that Howard can't explain.
- The innie's year of love leaves a residue in the outie.

**The Choice:**
- Howard sees Elizabeth. Actually *sees* her.
- He can look away (loop - nothing changes, self-loathing wins)
- He can approach her (the second chance)

**The Second Chance:**
- It feels like the first chance because Howard doesn't remember
- But he arrives with momentum—the innie's emotional truth bleeding through
- He asks her to go for a walk
- Not a "happy ending"—just a beginning. He finally showed up.

## Thematic Core

**The Lie:** "I severed so I could focus on my dream."
**The Truth:** "I severed because I couldn't face myself."

**The Innie's Arc:** Finding meaning in the mundane, falling in love, leaving notes that say "I exist."
**The Outie's Arc:** Wasting a year, running from himself, missing everything that mattered.

**The Convergence Question:** Can Howard accept that he's worthy of love—not because he remembers, but because something in him finally believes it?

---

## The Mechanics

**Severance in this world causes temporal bleed at convergence:**
- The innie experiences time... differently (player sees it backwards)
- At convergence, emotional truths leak across the divide
- Not memories—just feelings, instincts, a pull
- The "second chance" feels like a first chance, but Howard arrives with unnamed momentum

---

## Themes

- Self-deception and the lies we need to survive
- The 9-to-5 grind vs. creative pursuit (and which is actually meaningful)
- Self-loathing as the real prison
- Finding identity in unexpected places
- Love as someone simply choosing you
- Compassion as the bridge between fractured selves

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (React 19, TypeScript)
- **GSAP** for animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Zustand** for state management

---

## Key Features

- **Innie-first structure** — Play the full work timeline backwards before seeing outside life
