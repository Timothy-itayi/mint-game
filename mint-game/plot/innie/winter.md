# INNIE - Winter (Month 12)

> The player's entry point. A world already lived-in. A relationship already built. We start at the end.

---

## Overview

**Timeline Position:** Month 12 of 12 (End of the year)
**Player Experience:** This is the FIRST thing players see
**Narrative Challenge:** Everything must feel established—relationships, rhythms, inside jokes. The player is learning the world while the characters act like they've been here forever.

**Howard & Elizabeth Status:** Peak intimacy. Comfortable. Real.

## The World State

### The Kitchen - Winter

The kitchen has **settled into Howard**. Or he's settled into it. Hard to tell which.

**Environmental Details:**
- Winter light through frosted windows—pale, blue-grey
- Condensation on the cold storage doors
- The hum of refrigeration units working overtime
- Christmas/holiday decorations half-heartedly put up (Mr. Simmons insisted)
- A worn path in the floor tiles where Howard walks between his station and the front
- His station has small personal touches—a specific way tools are arranged, a spot where he always puts his water bottle

**Seasonal Kitchen Work:**
- Hearty winter meals: soups, stews, slow-cooked proteins
- Root vegetables, winter greens
- Comfort food for customers escaping the cold
- Slower pace some days, rushes when weather keeps people home cooking less

---

## Character Dynamics (Established)

### Howard's Position

After a year, Howard is **part of the furniture**. He knows the rhythms:
- When Michael will disappear to vape
- Which days Mr. Simmons visits
- How to read Jacob's moods
- When Emma needs help vs. when she'll snap at an offer
- The exact timing of when Elizabeth takes her breaks

He's competent. Quiet. Reliable. The innie-Howard that exists here is **present** in a way his outie has never been.

### The Kitchen Staff

**Michael (Manager):**
- Still awkward, still telling unwanted stories
- But Howard has learned to navigate him
- Knows when to nod along, when to escape
- Almost feels sorry for him now—a year of watching someone fail to connect

**Jacob:**
- They've developed a quiet rapport
- Jacob shares conspiracy theories during slow moments
- Has dropped hints about "the nature of what we are"
- Howard doesn't fully understand but something resonates
- Jacob seems to know more than he says

**Emma:**
- They coexist peacefully
- She does her job, he does his
- Occasional genuine moments of teamwork
- She's mentioned the benefits enough that Howard's stopped hearing it

**Todd & Nat:**
- They finally got together (sometime in autumn)
- Annoying but sweet
- Howard finds himself oddly protective of their happiness
- They remind him of something he can't name

## Howard & Elizabeth - The Relationship

### The State of Things

They are **together**. Not officially, not with labels, but *together*.

**What this looks like:**
- Howard finds excuses to go to the front. Elizabeth finds excuses to visit the back.
- They have spots where they meet—the loading dock during her break, the corner by the cold storage
- Notes left for each other. Small things. Inside jokes.
- A language built over months: specific looks, gestures, phrases only they understand
- Physical comfort—standing close, brief touches, the ease of bodies that know each other

**What Howard feels (even if he can't articulate it):**
- He looks forward to work. Actually looks forward to it.
- Something in his chest when he sees her
- A version of himself that isn't broken
- He doesn't know why he deserves this. But he stopped questioning it.

### Key Moments in Winter

**The Routine:**
- Morning: Howard arrives, gets set up. Knows Elizabeth is at the till. The anticipation.
- Mid-morning: First excuse to go to front. Brief exchange. Enough to carry him.
- Lunch: They find each other. Loading dock if weather permits. Storage corner if not.
- Afternoon: The long stretch. Notes left in their spots.
- End of shift: Walking out at the same time. The almost-but-not-quite of leaving together.

**The Intimacy:**
- She knows how he takes his coffee (he didn't even know this mattered)
- He notices when she's had a hard customer
- They finish each other's sentences
- Silences are comfortable, not awkward
- She laughs at his dry humor. He didn't know he had humor.

## The Notes

Notes are **central** to their relationship. This is how innies communicate across time—with themselves and each other.

**In Winter, the notes are:**
- Casual, intimate
- References to shared experiences
- Inside jokes
- Simple warmth: "Saw you yawn. Rough morning?" or "Loading dock at 2?"

**Where notes are left:**
- Howard's locker
- A specific spot behind the flour bags
- Tucked into Elizabeth's break schedule
- Under his water bottle

**The player discovers:**
- These notes exist
- They're from Elizabeth
- The relationship is clearly established
- But HOW it got here is a mystery (to be revealed backwards)

---

## Story Beats - Winter

### Beat 1: The Opening

Player enters the game mid-shift. Winter afternoon. Howard at his station. Everything feels... normal. Comfortable. Routine.

**The world establishes itself through:**
- Howard's muscle memory (he knows where everything is)
- Other characters treating him as familiar
- The small rituals of his station
- A note he finds from Elizabeth—intimate, casual, clearly not new

### Beat 2: The Rhythm

Player experiences a day (or several days compressed) of Howard's winter routine:
- Kitchen work
- Moments with co-workers
- The pull toward Elizabeth
- Finding/leaving notes
- The comfort of having a place in the world

### Beat 3: Something Jacob Says

Jacob, during a quiet moment, says something that sticks:
- Could be about time, memory, the nature of their work
- Cryptic but resonant
- Howard brushes it off but the player remembers
- Seeds planted for the larger mystery

### Beat 4: The Winter Intimacy

A significant moment between Howard and Elizabeth:
- Loading dock in the cold
- Real conversation
- Physical closeness—holding hands, leaning together
- Elizabeth says something that reveals depth: she sees Howard, truly sees him
- Howard feels seen without knowing how rare that is

### Beat 5: The Ending (Which is the Beginning of Reversal)

The chapter ends with:
- A sense of completeness
- Howard has found something here
- The player feels the weight of what's been built
- Then—time shifts. We move to AUTUMN.
- Everything is slightly less intimate. The unmaking begins.

## Environmental Storytelling

### What Players Notice (That Hints at Time)

**If observant, players might notice:**
- Howard's station looks "settled in"—personalized over time
- The holiday decorations suggest a specific time
- References to things that happened "months ago"
- The ease of relationships that took time to build

**Seasonal Cues:**
- Winter produce in the kitchen
- Weather references
- Customer patterns (holiday shopping, New Year prep)
- Staff conversations about the year ending

---

## Player Experience Goals

By the end of Winter (Month 12), the player should:

1. **Understand the world** — Kitchen layout, character dynamics, daily rhythms
2. **Feel the relationship** — Howard and Elizabeth are real, intimate, comfortable
3. **Sense the mystery** — Something about time, about Jacob's hints, about how innies work
4. **Be invested** — Care about what Howard has built here
5. **Feel grounded** — This world feels lived-in, not just introduced

**The irony the player doesn't know yet:**
- This is the END of the story, not the beginning
- Everything they're seeing was BUILT over a year
- The next chapter (Autumn) will show it slightly less developed
- They're about to watch love unmake itself

---

## Notes for Writing

- Dialogue should feel comfortable, not expository
- Characters reference shared history without explaining it
- Elizabeth and Howard communicate in shorthand
- The kitchen routines should feel REAL—based on actual kitchen work rhythms
- Winter atmosphere: cold outside, warm inside, holiday melancholy, year-end reflection
- Jacob's hints should be intriguing but not on-the-nose

---

## Transition to Autumn

The shift should feel like:
- Time has... moved? But backwards?
- Elizabeth and Howard are still close, but something's different
- Less intimate. More tentative.
- The player starts to realize: "Wait, this is EARLIER"

The first backward step in the unmaking of love.
