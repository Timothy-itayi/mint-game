# OUTIE - Spring (Month 1)

> The true beginning. Howard's outside life. The reason he severed. The player finally sees who he is when he's not at work.

---

## Overview

**Timeline Position:** Month 1 of 12 (First month of severance)
**Player Experience:** First outie chapter — we now move FORWARD in time
**Narrative Challenge:** Establish Howard's hollow life, his self-loathing, and why he chose severance.

**Direction:** Forward → (Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter)

---

## The World Outside

### Howard's Apartment

**The space tells the story:**
- Small, cramped, affordable
- Art books stacked everywhere—spines uncracked or barely touched
- A desk with drawing supplies, pristine and untouched
- Half-started sketches in a drawer, abandoned
- Empty canvases leaning against walls
- Dishes piling up
- Curtains often closed
- The space of someone who's given up

**What Howard tells himself:**
- "Now I'll have time to draw"
- "The severance will give me focus"
- "8 hours of my day just handled—I can finally create"

**The reality:**
- He sits in silence
- He scrolls his phone
- He stares at the blank canvas
- He never starts

---

## Howard's Mental State

**The self-loathing:**
- Doesn't believe he's good enough to make art
- Doesn't believe he's good enough for anything
- The severance was escape, not opportunity
- Deleting 8 hours of consciousness = 8 hours he doesn't have to be himself

**The lie he tells himself:**
- "This is about the art"
- "I just need time"
- "Once I'm rested, I'll start"

**The truth he avoids:**
- He's been lying for years
- Time was never the problem
- He is the problem

## Elizabeth - In the Margins

### The Neighbor Dynamic

Elizabeth lives across the hall. This is established early.

**What the player sees:**
- Brief hallway encounters
- Polite but distant interactions
- Elizabeth trying to connect, Howard keeping distance
- She's friendly, he's... not rude, but closed off

**Key Moments:**

**The Mailbox:**
- They're both checking mail
- She says something friendly
- He responds minimally, escapes

**The Hallway:**
- Coming home at similar times
- She smiles, he nods
- The door closes before conversation can develop

**The player knows:**
- This is the girl the innie falls in love with
- She's RIGHT THERE
- Howard can't see her

## Story Beats - Spring

### Beat 1: The Decision

We see Howard before or just after severance:
- The "opportunity" presented to him
- His rationalization: "This will help me focus on my art"
- The first severance—the moment of split
- Coming home after his first day (that he doesn't remember)

### Beat 2: The Routine Forms

Howard's outside life establishes itself:
- Wake up, lose time to nothing
- Stare at art supplies
- Order food, watch screens
- Avoid, avoid, avoid
- Sleep

### Beat 3: Elizabeth Appears

First clear appearance of Elizabeth as a neighbor:
- A hallway moment
- She's warm, he's distant
- The player feels the missed opportunity
- This is where it could start—if Howard could just LOOK

### Beat 4: The Empty Canvas

A scene that crystallizes Howard's problem:
- He sits in front of the canvas
- Picks up a pencil
- Puts it down
- Walks away
- The art was always an excuse

### Beat 5: Time Moves

Spring ends. Summer begins.
- Nothing has changed
- Howard has made no art
- He's been severed for a month
- The lie is intact

---

## Player Experience Goals

By the end of Spring, the player should:

1. **Understand the contrast** — Innie is open and present; outie is closed and avoidant
2. **See the lie** — Art was never happening
3. **Notice Elizabeth** — She's there, trying, and Howard misses it
4. **Feel the waste** — Time passes with nothing to show

---

## The Irony the Player Knows

While outie-Howard was sitting in his apartment doing nothing:
- Innie-Howard was starting a new job
- Innie-Howard was meeting people, learning rhythms
- Innie-Howard was becoming someone present

The severance wasn't helping Howard create. It was just dividing his failure from his escape.

---

## Notes for Writing

- Howard's apartment should feel oppressive despite being his "sanctuary"
- Elizabeth encounters should be brief but loaded—the player knows what she becomes
- The self-loathing should be shown, not told—through action and avoidance
- Spring atmosphere outside: renewal, hope, new beginnings (contrast to Howard's stagnation)
